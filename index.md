Hi there, whoever is reading this!

In these notes, I aggregate my knowledge about bare-metal programming in assembly language and operating systems development for devices based on ARM processors operating in AArch64 mode.

I do system programming as a hobby and write notes mostly for myself to better arrange in mind what I learn and be able to brush up on it when forgotten.

Yet, I'll be happy if you find here something useful for yourselves.
