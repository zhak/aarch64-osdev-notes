Hi there, whoever is reading this!

In these notes, I aggregate my knowledge about bare-metal programming and operating systems development for devices based on ARM processors operating in AArch64 mode.

I write notes mostly for myself to better arrange in mind what I learn and be able to brush up on it when forgotten, but I'll be happy if you also find here something useful for yourselves.
